            In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly

            physis (φύσις), which originally related to the

            and other features of the world to develop of
            their own accord. The concept of nature
            as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
            several expansions of the original notion;
            it began with certain core applications of
            the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
            (though this word had a dynamic dimension
